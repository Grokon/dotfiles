### Notes
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

I was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about
(which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too). That led to this
project being much more topic-centric. I realized I could split a lot of things
up into the main areas I used (git, system libraries, and so on), so I
structured the project accordingly. I also created branches for WSL and MacOS since those are my two environments.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to [read Holman's post on the
subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## what's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you.
[Fork holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/fork) or [Fork mine](htps://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't
use, and build on what you do use.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **Brewfile**: This is a list of applications for [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) to install: things like Chrome and 1Password and Adium and stuff. Might want to edit this file before running any initial setup.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## Git clone
There are two "master" branches here: WSL and MacOS.

If you wish to clone these filesa and run scripts manually, run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine. You also might want to configure `.tmux.conf` since I run a few scripts in the status bar.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.

## bugs

I want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should
work for you even though you may not have `rbenv` installed, for example. That
said, I do use this as *my* dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break
something if I forget to make a check for a dependency.

If you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues) on this repository
and I'd love to get it fixed for you!

## thanks

I forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' excellent
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for a couple years before the
weight of my changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my own. But Ryan's
dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship
to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are
inspired from Ryan's original project.


.tmux
=====

Self-contained, pretty and versatile `.tmux.conf` configuration file.

![Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/553208/19740585/85596a5a-9bbf-11e6-8aa1-7c8d9829c008.gif)

Installation
------------

Requirements:

  - tmux **`>= 2.1`** running inside Linux, Mac, OpenBSD, Cygwin or WSL (Bash on
    Ubuntu on Windows)
  - outside of tmux, `$TERM` must be set to `xterm-256color`

To install, run the following from your terminal: (you may want to backup your
existing `~/.tmux.conf` first)

```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git
$ ln -s -f .tmux/.tmux.conf
$ cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .
```

Then proceed to [customize] your `~/.tmux.conf.local` copy.

[customize]: #enabling-the-powerline-look

If you're a Vim user, setting the `$EDITOR` environment variable to `vim` will
enable and further customize the vi-style key bindings (see tmux manual).

If you're new to tmux, I recommend you read [tmux 2: Productive Mouse-Free
Development][bhtmux2] by [@bphogan].

Troubleshooting
---------------

 - **I'm running tmux `HEAD` and things don't work properly. What should I do?**

   Please open an issue describing what doesn't work with upcoming tmux. I'll do
   my best to address it.

 - **Status line is broken and/or gets duplicated at the bottom of the screen.
   What gives?**

   This particularly happens on Linux when the distribution provides a version
   of glib that received Unicode 9.0 upgrades (glib `>= 2.50.1`) while providing
   a version of glibc that didn't (glibc `< 2.26`). You may also configure
   `LC_CTYPE` to use an `UTF-8` locale. Typically VTE based terminal emulators
   rely on glib's `g_unichar_iswide()` function while tmux relies on glibc's
   `wcwidth()` function. When these two functions disagree, display gets messed
   up.

   This can also happen on macOS when using iTerm2 and "Use Unicode version 9
   character widths" is enabled in `Preferences... > Profiles > Text`

   For that reason, the default `~/.tmux.conf.local` file stopped using Unicode
   characters for which width changed in between Unicode 8.0 and 9.0 standards,
   as well as Emojis.

 - **I installed Powerline and/or (patched) fonts but can't see Powerline
   symbols.**

   First, you don't need to install Powerline. You only need fonts patched with
   Powerline symbols or the standalone `PowerlineSymbols.otf` font. Then make
   sure your `~/.tmux.conf.local` copy uses the right code points for
   `tmux_conf_theme_left_separator_XXX` values.

 - **I'm using Bash On Windows (WSL), colors and Powerline look are broken.**

   There is currently a [bug][1681] in the new console powering Bash On Windows
   preventing text attributes (bold, underscore, ...) to combine properly with
   colors. The workaround is to search your `~/.tmux.conf.local` copy and
   replace attributes with `'none'`.

   Also, until Window's console replaces its GDI based render with a DirectWrite
   one, Powerline symbols will be broken.

   The alternative is to use the [Mintty terminal for WSL][wsltty].

Features
--------

 - `C-a` acts as secondary prefix, while keeping default `C-b` prefix
 - visual theme inspired by [Powerline][]
 - [maximize any pane to a new window with `<prefix> +`][maximize-pane]
 - SSH/Mosh aware username and hostname status line information
 - mouse mode toggle with `<prefix> m`
 - automatic usage of [`reattach-to-user-namespace`][reattach-to-user-namespace]
   if available
 - laptop battery status line information
 - uptime status line information
 - optional highlight of focused pane (tmux `>= 2.1`)
 - configurable new windows and panes behavior (optionally retain current path)
 - SSH/Mosh aware split pane (reconnects to remote server)
 - copy to OS clipboard (needs [`reattach-to-user-namespace`][reattach-to-user-namespace]
   on macOS, `xsel` or `xclip` on Linux)
 - [Facebook PathPicker][] integration if available
 - [Urlview][] integration if available

[Powerline]: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline
[maximize-pane]: http://pempek.net/articles/2013/04/14/maximizing-tmux-pane-new-window/
[reattach-to-user-namespace]: https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard
[Facebook PathPicker]: https://facebook.github.io/PathPicker/
[Urlview]: https://packages.debian.org/stable/misc/urlview

The "maximize any pane to a new window with `<prefix> +`" feature is different
from builtin `resize-pane -Z` as it allows you to further split a maximized
pane. It's also more flexible by allowing you to maximize a pane to a new
window, then change window, then go back and the pane is still in maximized
state in its own window. You can then minimize a pane by using `<prefix> +`
either from the source window or the maximized window.

![Maximize pane](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/553208/9890858/ee3c0ca6-5c02-11e5-890e-05d825a46c92.gif)

Mouse mode allows you to set the active window, set the active pane, resize
panes and automatically switches to copy-mode to select text.

Bindings
--------

tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a
prefix key, followed by a command key. This configuration uses `C-a` as a
secondary prefix while keeping `C-b` as the default prefix. In the following
list of key bindings:
  - `<prefix>` means you have to either hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>
  - `<prefix> c` means you have to hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> followed by <kbd>c</kbd>
  - `<prefix> C-c` means you have to hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> followed by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

This configuration uses the following bindings:

 - `<prefix> e` opens `~/.tmux.conf.local` with the editor defined by the
   `$EDITOR` environment variable (defaults to `vim` when empty)
 - `<prefix> r` reloads the configuration
 - `C-l` clears both the screen and the tmux history

 - `<prefix> C-c` creates a new session
 - `<prefix> C-f` lets you switch to another session by name

 - `<prefix> C-h` and `<prefix> C-l` let you navigate windows (default
   `<prefix> n` and `<prefix> p` are unbound)
 - `<prefix> Tab` brings you to the last active window

 - `<prefix> -` splits the current pane vertically
 - `<prefix> _` splits the current pane horizontally
 - `<prefix> h`, `<prefix> j`, `<prefix> k` and `<prefix> l` let you navigate
   panes ala Vim
 - `<prefix> H`, `<prefix> J`, `<prefix> K`, `<prefix> L` let you resize panes
 - `<prefix> <` and `<prefix> >` let you swap panes
 - `<prefix> +` maximizes the current pane to a new window

 - `<prefix> m` toggles mouse mode on or off

 - `<prefix> U` launches Urlview (if available)
 - `<prefix> F` launches Facebook PathPicker (if available)

 - `<prefix> Enter` enters copy-mode
 - `<prefix> b` lists the paste-buffers
 - `<prefix> p` pastes from the top paste-buffer
 - `<prefix> P` lets you choose the paste-buffer to paste from

Additionally, `copy-mode-vi` matches [my own Vim configuration][]

[my own Vim configuration]: https://github.com/gpakosz/.vim.git

Bindings for `copy-mode-vi`:

- `v` begins selection / visual mode
- `C-v` toggles between blockwise visual mode and visual mode
- `H` jumps to the start of line
- `L` jumps to the end of line
- `y` copies the selection to the top paste-buffer
- `Escape` cancels the current operation

Configuration
-------------

While this configuration tries to bring sane default settings, you may want to
customize it further to your needs. Instead of altering the `~/.tmux.conf` file
and diverging from upstream, the proper way is to edit the `~/.tmux.conf.local`
file.

Please refer to the default `~/.tmux.conf.local` file to know more about
variables you can adjust to alter different behaviors. Pressing `<prefix> e`
will open `~/.tmux.conf.local` with the editor defined by the `$EDITOR`
environment variable (defaults to `vim` when empty).

### Enabling the Powerline look

Powerline originated as a status-line plugin for Vim. Its popular eye-catching
look is based on the use of special symbols: <img width="80" alt="Powerline Symbols" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/553208/10687156/1b76dda6-796b-11e5-83a1-1634337c4571.png" />

To make use of these symbols, there are several options:

- use a font that already bundles those: this is e.g. the case of the
  [2.030R-ro/1.050R-it version][source code pro] of the Source Code Pro font
- use a [pre-patched font][powerline patched fonts]
- use your preferred font along with the [Powerline font][powerline font] (that
  only contains the Powerline symbols): [this highly depends on your operating
  system and your terminal emulator][terminal support]

[source code pro]: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/tag/2.030R-ro/1.050R-it
[powerline patched fonts]: https://github.com/powerline/fonts
[powerline font]: https://github.com/powerline/powerline/raw/develop/font/PowerlineSymbols.otf
[terminal support]: http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage.html#usage-terminal-emulators
[Powerline manual]: http://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#fonts-installation

Please see the [Powerline manual] for further details.

Then edit the `~/.tmux.conf.local` file (`<prefix> e`) and adjust the following
variables:

```
tmux_conf_theme_left_separator_main=''
tmux_conf_theme_left_separator_sub=''
tmux_conf_theme_right_separator_main=''
tmux_conf_theme_right_separator_sub=''
```
### Configuring the status line

Contrary to the first iterations of this configuration, by now you have total
control on the content and order of `status-left` and `status-right`.

Edit the `~/.tmux.conf.local` file (`<prefix> e`) and adjust the
`tmux_conf_theme_status_left` and `tmux_conf_theme_status_right` variables to
your own preferences.

This configuration supports the following builtin variables:

 - `#{battery_bar}`: horizontal battery charge bar
 - `#{battery_percentage}`: battery percentage
 - `#{battery_status}`: is battery charging or discharging?
 - `#{battery_vbar}`: vertical battery charge bar
 - `#{circled_session_name}`: circled session number, up to 20
 - `#{hostname}`: SSH/Mosh aware hostname information
 - `#{hostname_ssh}`: SSH/Mosh aware hostname information, blank when not
   connected to a remote server through SSH/Mosh
 - `#{loadavg}`: load average
 - `#{pairing}`: is session attached to more than one client?
 - `#{prefix}`: is prefix being depressed?
 - `#{root}`: is current user root?
 - `#{synchronized}`: are the panes synchronized?
 - `#{uptime_d}`: uptime days
 - `#{uptime_h}`: uptime hours
 - `#{uptime_m}`: uptime minutes
 - `#{uptime_s}`: uptime seconds
 - `#{username}`: SSH/Mosh aware username information
 - `#{username_ssh}`: SSH aware username information, blank when not connected
   to a remote server through SSH/Mosh

Beside custom variables mentioned above, the `tmux_conf_theme_status_left` and
`tmux_conf_theme_status_right` variables support usual tmux syntax, e.g. using
`#()` to call an external command that inserts weather information provided by
[wttr.in]:
```
tmux_conf_theme_status_right='#{prefix}#{pairing}#{synchronized} #(curl wttr.in?format=3) , %R , %d %b | #{username}#{root} | #{hostname} '
```

### Accessing the macOS clipboard from within tmux sessions

[Chris Johnsen created the `reattach-to-user-namespace`
utility][reattach-to-user-namespace] that makes `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` work
again within tmux.

To install `reattach-to-user-namespace`, use either [MacPorts][] or
[Homebrew][]:

    $ port install tmux-pasteboard

or

    $ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace

Once installed, `reattach-to-usernamespace` will be automatically detected.

[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
